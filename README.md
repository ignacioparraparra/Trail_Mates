# Trail_Mates
### Turn your camping trip or dream getaway with your besties from group chat fantasy to real-life adventure!

# Goal
* Create web app with user authentication, which then allows users the ability for real time messaging and collaberation with friends they invite to their planner.

# Key Focuses
* Picking and configuring a database
* Implementing user auth and API's
* real time messaging

# Updates
## TrailMates v0.1 - Landing Page Build 08/13/25

### Trying to achieve nice landing page and some sort of user authentication

## TrailMates v0.2 - UI and User Auth 08/23/25
* Landing page is finally done! As well after implementing my own authentication, I decided to pivot to the Auth0 api for more security and practice of implementing third party API's. When user clicks plan trip, they are redirected to Auth0 to sign in then redirected to their dashboard page.
